Simple Python Chatbot

This Python-based chatbot responds to predefined user inputs using if-else conditions and can handle minor misspellings. It also executes system commands, making it a lightweight assistant.

Features

Responds to predefined text inputs, including common greetings, jokes, and random facts.
Can understand small typos and give a friendly reminder that it’s still learning if it doesn’t recognize the command.
Opens system applications like Visual Studio Code, Google, YouTube, and File Explorer.
Plays songs, checks the weather, and provides quotes, movie recommendations, and other useful info.
Example Commands

"hello" → responds with "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
"play song" → plays a random song.
"weather in [city]" → provides the weather of the specified city.
"open calculator" → opens the calculator app.
"suggest a good movie to watch?" → recommends a movie like "Inception."
Handling Typos If the chatbot doesn’t understand a command or detects a typo, it will politely let you know it’s still learning and encourage you to try again. For example, typing "how do I stay helthy?" will prompt the chatbot to respond, "I'm still learning, but did you mean 'how to stay healthy'?"
