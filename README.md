# Chat-bot
A simple Python chatbot using if-else conditions to respond to user inputs. It can recognize predefined messages and execute system commands like opening files, applications, and tools such as Visual Studio Code, Microsoft To-Do List, and more. The chatbot also improves usability by handling minor misspellings.
